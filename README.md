# Hawg_Parts
This is the repository for the panels created to enhance my own DCS A-10C Experience.  This is primarily for me to gain experience and skills with github.
The structure of the library is panel based which potentially have both a hardware and a software dimension.  Hardware schematics and designs are Eagle format.  Most of the software is Atmel AVR C for the microcontrollers and C or LUA for the code which interfaces between the simulator and the microcontrollers.
